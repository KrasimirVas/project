Judd Trump hopes he can keep his hot streak of form going as he looks ahead to the Betway UK Championship in York.

Trump won last week’s Northern Ireland Open in Belfast, his first ranking title in over a year. He won seven matches, culminating in a superb 9-7 defeat of Ronnie O’Sullivan in the final.
