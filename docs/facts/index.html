            <h3>15 facts about Snooker’s World Championship</h3>

    <article class="snooker-facts">
        <h4>Here is a selection of fascinating facts about the sport’s most prestigious tournament.</h4>
        <p><span>1. </span> The Crucible has staged snooker’s premier event since 1977, after tournament promoter Mike Watterson was told by wife Carol the theatre was perfect for the sport. She had watched a play there, and on her advice Watterson took the World Championship to a venue with which it has become synonymous.</p>
        <p><span>2. </span>Golf’s newest major winner, Masters champion Danny Willett, is a big snooker fan and visited the Crucible last year. Sheffield ace Willett played a frame with Mark Allen on the practice tables before watching live action from the table-side press seats.</p>
        <p><span>3. </span>Snooker is more rock and roll than you might imagine. Recent visitors to the tournament have included Iron Maiden drummer Nicko McBrain, Muse frontman Matt Bellamy and Pulp’s Jarvis Cocker. Keen cueman McBrain stepped behind the drums with a covers band at the 2014 after-final party, as new champion Mark Selby belted out REM’s Losing My Religion.</p>

        <p><span>4. </span>Ronnie O’Sullivan plundered the fastest 147 maximum break in snooker history at the 1997 World Championship, making the perfect clearance in a bewilderingly rapid five minutes and 20 seconds against Mick Price.</p>

        <p><span>5. </span>Promoters in Beijing have built a replica Crucible, as they make overtures to take the World Championship to China. Having been told the Crucible had a unique nature, the cheekily identical set-up could make China’s case all the more persuasive in future. However Sheffield has the tournament until at least 2017, and reports have indicated a longer-term deal may be close to being confirmed. 6. The current world champion Stuart Bingham claimed the ultimate scalp on his Crucible debut, when as a 23-year-old qualifier in 2000 he beat seven-time winner Stephen Hendry 10-7 in the first round, causing one of the tournament’s greatest upsets. 7. There have been 10 maximum breaks at the World Championship. Canadian Cliff Thorburn made the first in 1983, while Stephen Hendry and O’Sullivan have each fired three, with Jimmy White, Ali Carter and Mark Williams the other men to achieve the feat. Hendry made the most recent World Championship maximum, on day one of the 2012 tournament. Robert Milkins has made two 147s in the qualifying rounds.</p>

        <p><span>9. </span>Derbyshire player Joe Davis was the first world champion in 1927 and won all 15 editions of the tournament he entered. His last title came in 1946 when he retired unbeaten from the World Championship. 10. Only two players entered the 1931 World Championship. Tom Dennis, in whose pub the event was staged, lost 25-21 to Joe Davis. 11. The youngest world champion was Stephen Hendry in 1990. The Scot was just 21 when he beat Jimmy White 18-12. 12. In 2005 Shaun Murphy became the first player to come through qualifying and win the world title. Judd Trump almost matched him in 2011 but lost out to John Higgins in the final.</p>

        <p><span>13.</span>A British television audience of 18.5million watched Dennis Taylor beat Steve Davis on the final black in the 1985 final. It set a viewing record for BBC Two and a post-midnight record for all channels, both of which still stand. </p>

        <p><span>14. </span> There has been only one whitewash in a match at the World Championship. It came in the first round in 1992, when 62-year-old Australian Eddie Charlton was beaten 10-0 by defending champion John Parrott./p>    
        <p><span>15. </span>Jimmy White, Walter Donaldson and Fred Davis have each lost six finals – a record. White, unlike Donaldson and Davis, has never been a world champion but he continues to chase the dream and lost this year in the first round of qualifying.</p>
