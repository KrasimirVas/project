&lt;p&gt;Murphy has had a disappointing start to the 2018/19 campaign, failing to go beyond the last 16 of a ranking event, but this was the most surprising defeat of his season so far. He took the UK title in 2008 and was runner-up in 2012 and 2017, but this time the world number nine misses out on the TV stages in York.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Shaun Murphy, champion ten years ago, suffered a shock 6-3 defeat against world number 124 Chen Feilong in the first round of the Betway UK Championship.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Lucky Higgins Edges Out Poomjaeng</title><link href="/project/2018/11/29/lucky-higgins.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Lucky Higgins Edges Out Poomjaeng" /><published>2018-11-29T06:23:03+02:00</published><updated>2018-11-29T06:23:03+02:00</updated><id>/project/2018/11/29/lucky-higgins</id><content type="html" xml:base="/project/2018/11/29/lucky-higgins.html">&lt;p&gt;After the shock exits of Shaun Murphy and Ryan Day earlier in the day Higgins looked in danger of becoming another high profile casualty in the first round in York when he frittered away leads of 4-1 and 5-3. He made a break of 101 in the fourth frame but otherwise struggled for fluency as Thailand’s Poomjaeng battled back to 5-5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amateur cueman Poomjaeng had two early chances in the deciding frame but missed one red to a centre pocket and another to a baulk corner. Gritty Higgins made a crucial break of 60 which proved enough for victory in a match which finished at 12.30am. Three-time UK Champion Higgins now faces a tartan tussle against Alan McManus in the last 64.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s the way I have been playing all season, it’s no surprise to me how badly I struggled there,” said 43-year-old Higgins. “I was really lucky because Dechawat had a good chance in the last frame, if he had potted the red to the middle I would have fancied him to make a frame-winning break because all the balls were there.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">After the shock exits of Shaun Murphy and Ryan Day earlier in the day Higgins looked in danger of becoming another high profile casualty in the first round in York when he frittered away leads of 4-1 and 5-3.
